# About
Hey, I'm Sam aka LabManSec - thank you so much for stopping by my little corner of the Internet! I'm newly-minted offensive security professional with a background incident response and detection engineering. My passions are mainly around red team execution, operational efficiency, and education.

I'm always open for a conversation - whether its new information to learn, questions to be answered, or just a nice chat with a fellow infosec professional. You can reach me most easily on Discord under the "LabManSec" username.
